## Description
This project is about creating an SVG Logo from the Command Line Interface. It features three shapes that the user can choose from, then allows for selecting colors for the letters and the shape's background. Even though the output may seem simple compared to the magnitude of the code, this project serves as a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming. It showcases how to use classes, objects, and functions, as well as how they inherit properties and parameters from one another.
